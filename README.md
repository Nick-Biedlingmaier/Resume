<h2 align="center">Hello, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p align="center">
  Adept IT pro with 15+ years of experience. Technician | Manager | Mentor.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Professional "Swiss Army knife" IT guy ðŸ’ª with 16 years in the field in various capacities focused on technical support, IT, team management, and customer service. I intentionally never specialized because being a Generalist has been a boon to every company I've been with, it makes me flexible and quick on my feet.
</p>

<p align="center">
  If I am in a leadership position, I prefer teams of less than 10 and the ability to work alongside them. I love solving problems as an individual contributor, and would never want to lose those chops to mundane management! I engage with my teams, ensure they are on-target, or if I am solo I ensure I meet all SLA and KPI goals.
